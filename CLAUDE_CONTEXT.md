# PRVS Dashboard — Claude Context Document

> **This is Claude's memory across sessions.** Claude has no memory between sessions.
> Every session MUST start by reading this file. Every session MUST update this file before ending.

---

## ⚡ SESSION PROTOCOL — READ THIS FIRST

### 🟢 START OF SESSION CHECKLIST
Claude must complete all of these before doing any work:

- [ ] 1. Read this entire file top to bottom
- [ ] 2. Confirm the current `index.html` version matches the File Inventory table below
- [ ] 3. Read and acknowledge the **Active TODO List** section aloud to Roland
- [ ] 4. Ask Roland: *"Is there anything new to add or change from the TODO list before we start?"*
- [ ] 5. Only then begin work — starting with the highest-priority TODO item unless Roland redirects

### 🔴 END OF SESSION CHECKLIST
Claude must complete ALL of these before the session ends (context limit, user stops, etc.):

- [ ] 1. Update the **Active TODO List** — mark completed items ✅, add any new items discovered
- [ ] 2. Update the **File Inventory** table with new version numbers
- [ ] 3. Add a row to the **Session Log** table
- [ ] 4. Add new items to **Completed Work**
- [ ] 5. Update the **Version History** table if version was bumped
- [ ] 5a. If version was bumped: add a **GitHub Release TODO** to the Active TODO List for Roland to publish at github.com/PatriotsRV/rv-dashboard/releases/new
- [ ] 6. Add any new bugs, gotchas, or design decisions to the **Known Issues & Gotchas** section
- [ ] 7. **Run `bash scripts/backup.sh`** before pushing — creates timestamped snapshot in `.backups/`, keeps last 6
- [ ] 8. Commit and push CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md to GitHub

> ⚠️ If the session is about to end due to context limits, Claude should say:
> *"Context is getting full — let me update CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md before we lose this session."*
> and complete the End of Session Checklist before anything else.

## 📋 ACTIVE TODO LIST

> This is the canonical task list. Update it every session. Priorities: 🔴 Blocking · 🟠 High · 🟡 Medium · 🔵 Low

| Priority | # | Task | Notes | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | GH#10 | **Integrate Kenect messaging using the Kenect APIs** | v1.290 — 💬 Messages button on each RO card (requires customerPhone); chat-style modal with inbound/outbound bubbles; send message + review request; Admin Settings: Location ID config, Test Connection, Load Locations; `kenect-proxy` Supabase Edge Function (needs `KENECT_API_KEY` secret + deploy). **Roland action: `supabase secrets set KENECT_API_KEY=xxx` then deploy Edge Function** | ✅ Done v1.290 — pending deploy |
| 🔴 | — | **Set up Kenect — activate the integration** | Steps: 1) Get API key from Kenect (requested) 2) Ask Kenect about per-user attribution (userId/agentId field on send, or separate tokens) 3) Install Homebrew → Supabase CLI → `supabase secrets set KENECT_API_KEY=xxx` → `supabase functions deploy kenect-proxy` 4) In Admin Settings → Kenect: set Location ID, Test Connection 5) Map each PRVS user email to their Kenect User ID once Kenect confirms the auth model | ⏳ Roland action — today |
| 🔴 | GH#1 | **Start Twilio number port** | Port existing number — blocks all SMS features | ⏳ Open |
| 🟠 | GH#4 | **Twilio SMS v1.27** | Customer + tech notifications via SMS | ⏳ Open |
| ✅ | GH#14 | **Parts chip states — Sourcing / Outstanding / Received / Estimate** | Four-state system: 🔍 Part Sourcing (neon orange), ⚠️ Parts Outstanding (yellow), ✅ Parts Received (green), 📋 Parts Estimate (blue, pulsing). `parts_status` column on `repair_orders`. Auto-flip to Received when all parts marked received. Manager/Admin set status modal. For Estimate Only toggle in Request Parts modal. Filter buttons for all four states. bobby@, solar@, brandon@ added to MANAGER_EMAILS + Supabase. | ✅ Done v1.284–v1.285 |
| 🟠 | GH#5 | **Work Assignment System — expanded scope** | Full spec: (1) For Service-type ROs, Manager can expand the repair type into individual bulleted **Service Tasks** (sub-work-items within the RO). (2) Each Service Task gets its own status — replaces the current single RO Status with per-task status tracking. (3) Service Managers build out the work order for their specific service: create task list, set task details, assign each task to a specific technician. (4) Technicians see only their assigned tasks. (5) Overall RO status becomes a rollup of task completion. (6) **Manager sets RO Urgency** — lock urgency selector to Manager+Admin only (currently open to all users). (7) **Each Service Task has its own dollar value** set by the responsible Service Manager — task values roll up to the total RO dollar value (replaces/supplements current single `dollarValue` field). DB changes: new `service_tasks` table (ro_id, task_title, assigned_tech_email, status, sort_order, notes, dollar_value); RO total = SUM of task dollar_values. UI changes: RO card shows task checklist + per-task value + rolled-up total; Manager modal to add/edit/assign tasks and set value per task; urgency selector restricted to Manager+Admin. | ⏳ Open |
| 🟠 | GH#6 | **Employee Time Clock** | Full time clock feature in dashboard | ⏳ Open |
| 🟠 | GH#15 | **Virtual Lot Map + Parking Spot + QR Print** | Three-phase build: **(1) Parking Spot field** — add `parking_spot` dropdown to each RO (lot positions: Bay #1–#14, MR, #17, Wash Bay #15, Breeze Way, Front Parking, RV Temp, Gates); show prominently on RO card so techs can find the RV. **(2) QR Code print sheet at check-in** — printable page with 3"×3" QR (windshield) + 1"×1" QR (key tag), both labeled with customer name + RO number, scannable to open RO in dashboard; triggered from check-in or RO card. **(3) Interactive Virtual Lot Map** — new dashboard view mirroring the physical whiteboard layout (upper bays, lower bays, outdoor spots); each cell shows customer name + repair type when occupied; Manager clicks to assign/move RV; color-coded by urgency; replaces the physical whiteboard. Build order: 1 → 2 → 3. | ⏳ Open |
| ✅ | GH#13 | **Pre-deploy backup system** | `scripts/backup.sh` — 6-version rolling snapshots to `.backups/` before every push | ✅ Done |
| ✅ | GH#12 | **Spanish language toggle** | Full UI translation of presentation layer only — labels, buttons, modals, status text. DB stays English. `t()` function approach. Self-selectable toggle per user (localStorage). Globe icon in header. Both index.html (v1.277) and checkin.html (v1.27) done. | ✅ Done |
| 🟡 | GH#11 | **Solar Battery Bank tile — add Watt Hours** | Show Wh alongside Ah in Quote section (Wh = Ah × system voltage); update PDF output too | ⏳ Open |
| 🟡 | GH#9 | **Parts form autocomplete** | Suggest part names, suppliers, part numbers from existing `parts` table history — both Manage Parts and Parts Request modal | ⏳ Open |
| 🟡 | GH#2 | **Regular view layout customization** | Drag/resize tiles | ⏳ Open |

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Gotchas

> Things Claude MUST know going into any session. Add new discoveries here.

### Auth Architecture — CRITICAL to understand
- **`accessToken`** = Google OAuth token. Expires ~1 hour. ONLY needed for Google Drive / Google Calendar API calls. **Never use `!accessToken` as a guard for Supabase operations.**
- **`getSB()`** = Supabase client. Always available if user is logged in. Use `!getSB()` as the guard for all database/storage operations.
- **`supabaseSession`** = global holding the active Supabase session. Source of truth for auth state. Kept in sync via `onAuthStateChange` listener (`initSupabaseAuthListener()`).
- **Persistent sessions** — `persistSession: true`, `autoRefreshToken: true`, `storageKey: 'prvs_supabase_auth'`. Sessions last 30 days. Users must re-login once after v1.265 due to storageKey change.

### Nonce Flow (Google Sign-In → Supabase)
- Raw nonce = 16 random bytes as **hex string**
- Hashed nonce = SHA-256 of raw nonce, also **hex string** (NOT base64 — base64 was the v1.263 bug)
- `hashedNonce` goes as top-level `nonce:` in `google.accounts.id.initialize()` AND as `params: { nonce: hashedNonce }` (Chrome 145 compat)
- Both nonces stored in localStorage to survive async gaps

### Supabase `.single()` vs `.maybeSingle()`
- `.single()` throws a 406 error when zero rows are found
- Always use `.maybeSingle()` when 0 rows is a valid result (e.g., `getUserRole()`, any optional lookup)

### Audit Log — `writeAuditLog(roId, changes)`
- Signature: `writeAuditLog(roId, [{ field, oldValue, newValue }])`
- `roId` = PRVS string ID (e.g. "CUS-RV-2025-01-15"), NOT the Supabase UUID
- Function internally looks up the Supabase UUID via `currentData.find(d => d.roId === roId)`
- Include `user_id: supabaseSession?.user?.id` — this is already in the function, do NOT add it in callers
- **oldValue timing trap:** callers must pass oldValue BEFORE mutating `currentData`. If `currentData[i].field = newValue` is done before calling `writeAuditLog`, the old value is lost.

### Photo Migration (Drive → Supabase Storage)
- `photoJobs.push({ roId: ro.id, ... })` — `ro.id` IS the Supabase UUID (primary key)
- `ro.ro_id` is the PRVS string ID — do NOT confuse these
- The `.eq('id', job.roId)` calls are correct

### Calendar Scheduling Re-Auth
- `_pendingScheduleIndex` global stores the filtered-data index across the OAuth round-trip
- `reauthorizeCalendar(filteredIndex)` uses `prompt:'consent'` to force interactive popup
- After successful OAuth, `initSupabaseAuthListener()` in tokenClient callback re-opens the modal

### Parts Request System (v1.267–v1.269)
- `has_open_parts_request` boolean column on `repair_orders` — **requires SQL migration** (see TODO list)
- Parts request notes stored in `notes` table as `type: 'ro_status'` ONLY with body prefixed `🔩 PARTS REQUESTED: ...` — do NOT use `type: 'parts_request'` (violates `notes_type_check` constraint which only allows `ro_status` and `customer_comm`)
- History modal (`openPartsRequestDetails`) queries: `.eq('type', 'ro_status').ilike('body', '%PARTS REQUESTED%')` — not `.eq('type', 'parts_request')`
- Email uses `send-quote-email` Edge Function with `type: 'parts_request'` param — ✅ deployed (v1.3 with photo thumbnails confirmed live)
- Management email hardcoded as `parts@patriotsrvservices.com` — placeholder until email group is created
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` and `SUPABASE_URL` constants (defined at top of init block) are used directly in the fetch call — no auth header upgrade needed since Edge Function is public
- `markPartsOrdered()` is available to ALL roles (no role restriction) — business rule is that it's a manual acknowledgement only, tracked in audit log
- **Photo attachments (v1.269):** `_partsRequestFiles[]` is module-level (not inside any function) — FileList objects are immutable, so files are copied into this mutable array; cleared to `[]` on modal open. `URL.createObjectURL(file)` used for instant local previews. Photos uploaded via existing `uploadToSupabaseStorage(file, roId)` helper and added to `photo_library` via `parseLibrary`/`serializeLibrary`/`updatePhotoLibraryInSheet`.

### Upload Auth Pattern (v1.271)
- All upload functions (`uploadPhoto`, `uploadDocument`) must guard with `!getSB() || !supabaseSession` — NOT just `!getSB()`. `getSB()` always returns a truthy client object even when the session has expired; only `supabaseSession === null` reliably indicates "not authenticated"
- The session re-check must also be repeated INSIDE async `onchange` callbacks because the session can expire between when the file picker opens and when the user selects a file
- `uploadDocument` no longer uses Google Drive at all — it uses `uploadToSupabaseStorage(file, roId + '/docs')` → `addDocToLibrary`. Do NOT revert to Google Drive; `accessToken` is a short-lived Google OAuth token (~1 hour) and will always expire
- Document storage path in `rv-media` bucket: `{roId}/docs/{timestamp}_{filename}`

### editField — Two Distinct Behaviors
- `repairDescription` → **full replace**: modal pre-fills with current text, save writes the entire new value to `repair_orders.description`, audit log records old + new
- `roStatusNotes` / `customerCommunicationNotes` → **append-only**: blank modal, new text gets `[timestamp - user]` prefix appended with `\n---\n` separator, written as new row in `notes` table
- `showVoiceNotesModal(title, prefillValue = '')` — second param pre-fills textarea; leave empty for append-style fields

### RO ID Generation — Optimistic Insert Pattern (v1.280+)
- `generateROId(name, rv, date)` is a **deterministic 32-bit hash** — same inputs always produce the same ID. Safe for lookups/display; NOT safe as a direct insert key.
- **`generateROIdCandidates(name, rv, date)`** returns `[base, base-2, ..., base-9, base-XXXX]` — all possible IDs to try in order.
- **`appendToSupabase` uses an optimistic insert loop**: tries each candidate, on `error.code === '23505'` advances to next, any other error is thrown. No pre-SELECT needed — eliminates the check-then-insert race window entirely.
- Never revert to pre-checking with `generateUniqueROId` (deleted in v1.280) — concurrent submits could both pass the check and both fail on insert.

### Spanish Language Toggle (v1.277)
- **`t(str)`** — takes an English string as key, returns Spanish from `TRANSLATIONS_ES` or falls back to the English string. English IS the key — no abstract key names.
- **`getLang()` / `setLang(lang)`** — reads/writes `prvs_lang` in localStorage. `setLang` also calls `translateStaticUI()` and `renderBoard()`.
- **`setupI18n()`** — called once at `init()` time via `setTimeout(setupI18n, 50)`. Programmatically adds `data-i18n` attributes to static DOM elements (header h1, filter labels, filter buttons) using their English text as the key. Idempotent.
- **`translateStaticUI()`** — queries all `[data-i18n]` elements, updates text content. For elements with child ELEMENT_NODEs (e.g. filter labels with chevron spans), updates only the first TEXT_NODE. Also updates `[data-i18n-ph]` placeholder attributes and syncs the globe button label.
- **Emoji keys** — dict keys for some buttons include the emoji (e.g. `'🖨️ Print Label'`, `'🚪 Tech Check In'`, `'✏️ Edit RO'`). The emoji MUST be inside the `t()` call: `${t('🖨️ Print Label')}` NOT `🖨️ ${t('Print Label')}`.
- **DB values stay English** — status dropdown `value=""` attributes must remain English; only the displayed option text is wrapped with `t()`.
- **checkin.html** — Spanish toggle NOT yet applied to checkin.html (still open).

### `isAdmin()` Timing Bug (v1.282b)
- **Root cause:** `getUserInfo()` is called during `init()` even when no Google access token exists. With no token, it sets `currentUser = { email: 'unknown@user.com' }`. The session restore path has `if (!currentUser)` guard — which is `false` (currentUser is truthy) — so it never overwrites `currentUser` with the real email from the Supabase session. Result: `isAdmin()` checks `currentUser.email === 'unknown@user.com'` and returns `false`, even for real admins.
- **Fix pattern:** Any code that needs to check admin status after page load should do BOTH: `isAdmin() || ADMIN_EMAILS.includes((supabaseSession?.user?.email || '').toLowerCase())`. Do NOT rely on `isAdmin()` alone in post-load callbacks.
- **Affected areas:** Duplicate RO Manager post-load check. Any future feature that gates Admin UI based on role should use the same pattern.

### Inline `</script>` Tag Inside Template Literal — Parser Bomb
- If `modal.innerHTML = \`...\`` contains a literal `</script>` tag (e.g. an inline `<script>...</script>` block), the HTML parser treats it as closing the **outer** `<script>` block. Everything after that point is not parsed as JS.
- Symptom: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input` at the line where the outer script block would normally close + all global functions defined below that point become "not defined".
- **Fix:** Never put inline `<script>` blocks inside template literals assigned to `.innerHTML`. Move any JS logic to a globally-scoped named function and wire it via `onchange="myFunction()"` or `onclick="myFunction()"` attributes instead.
- Real example: `syncEstimateToggle()` was originally an inline `<script>` inside `openPartsStatusModal`'s `modal.innerHTML` — caused `gapiLoaded is not defined` and broke the entire page (v1.285 first attempt).

### Direct Pushes to main During Active Session — Causes Branch Divergence
- When Claude is in an active session editing `index.html`, our local git state is "ahead" of GitHub by our uncommitted/unpushed changes.
- If Roland pushes directly to GitHub during that window (e.g. backup restore, hotfix from GitHub web UI), the remote branch gets new commits that our local branch doesn't have. Claude's next `git push` is then rejected.
- **Recovery cost is high** — requires `git reset --hard origin/main` which discards all local session work, then full re-application of all changes from scratch.
- **Rule:** Never push directly to GitHub while a Claude session is active. If a restore is needed urgently, tell Claude at the **start of the next session** before any files are touched — Claude will `git pull` first.
- **Better alternative to direct pushes:** Use `ROLLBACK.md` commands or just start a new Claude session and say "roll back to vX.XXX".

### Pre-Deploy Backup System
- **Always run `bash scripts/backup.sh` before `git push origin main`** — this is step 7 of the End of Session Checklist
- Snapshots saved to `.backups/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/` — 6 rotating versions kept automatically
- Files backed up: `index.html`, `checkin.html`, `solar.html`, `analytics.html`, `supabase/functions/send-quote-email/index.ts`, `supabase/functions/roof-lookup/index.ts`
- To restore a file: `cp .backups/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/index.html ./index.html`
- `.backups/` is committed to the repo — visible and restorable without any git knowledge

### GitHub Push
- `gh` CLI is NOT available in the sandbox; use `git` directly from `/sessions/.../mnt/rv-dashboard/`
- The workspace folder IS the git repo — `git push origin main` works directly

## 🏛 Key Architecture Decisions

### Supabase RBAC
- RLS enabled on all 11 tables + storage bucket `rv-media`
- Helper function `has_role(role_name text)` — SECURITY DEFINER
- Pattern: `TO authenticated USING (true)` for reads; `WITH CHECK (has_role('Admin'))` for restricted writes
- **Status: ✅ Complete**

### Supabase Edge Function — roof-lookup
solar.html v2.0 calls `https://axfejhudchdejoiwaetq.supabase.co/functions/v1/roof-lookup` for AI roof dimension lookup. Code is committed but **must be deployed via CLI**:

```bash
npm install -g supabase
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref axfejhudchdejoiwaetq
supabase secrets set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
supabase functions deploy roof-lookup
```

### Supabase Edge Function — kenect-proxy (v1.290)
Proxies all Kenect API calls from the dashboard. Code is committed to `supabase/functions/kenect-proxy/index.ts`. **Must be deployed via CLI:**

```bash
supabase link --project-ref axfejhudchdejoiwaetq   # if not already linked
supabase secrets set KENECT_API_KEY=your_kenect_api_key_here
# Optional (can also be set per-user in Admin Settings):
supabase secrets set KENECT_LOCATION_ID=your_location_id
supabase functions deploy kenect-proxy
```

After deploy, open Admin Settings in the dashboard → Kenect section → click **Test Connection**.

**Kenect phone number format**: The dashboard normalizes `customerPhone` to E.164 (+1XXXXXXXXXX). If customers are stored as `555-1234` (7-digit), Kenect lookups will fail — full 10-digit numbers are required.

### Daily Backup
- `.github/workflows/backup.yml` — 8 AM UTC (4 AM EST) daily + manual trigger
- Exports all 11 tables via Supabase REST API (service role key)
- Pushes to private repo `prvshepard/rv-dashboard-backups`, rolling 30-day retention
- Required secrets: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `GH_BACKUP_PAT`
- **Status: ✅ Live and tested**

- ✅ **Parts Request System (v1.267)** — `openPartsRequestModal()` with voice dictation; `submitPartsRequest()` writes notes (type `parts_request` + `ro_status`), sets `has_open_parts_request=true`, emails `parts@patriotsrvservices.com`; neon-pink pulsing chip + card border on RO card; `openPartsRequestDetails()` shows history; `markPartsOrdered()` clears flag + logs resolution; `send-quote-email` v1.2 handles `type:'parts_request'` branch
- ✅ **notes_type_check fix (v1.268)** — Changed parts request note insert from `type:'parts_request'` to `type:'ro_status'` with `🔩 PARTS REQUESTED:` body prefix; history query uses `.ilike('body', '%PARTS REQUESTED%')`
- ✅ **Parts Request photo attachments (v1.269)** — `_partsRequestFiles[]` global array + `previewPartsPhotos/removePartsPhoto/renderPartsPhotoPreview` helpers; orange "📷 Attach / Take Photo(s)" button in modal; thumbnails with × remove; on submit uploads via `uploadToSupabaseStorage`, adds to RO `photo_library`, passes `photoUrls[]` to Edge Function; `send-quote-email` v1.3 embeds photos as inline clickable thumbnails in email HTML
- ✅ **RO Description inline edit fix (v1.270)** — `showVoiceNotesModal` now accepts optional `prefillValue` param; modal pre-fills textarea with existing description, cursor placed at end; `editField` branches on `repairDescription`: full replace on save (not append), old value captured from `currentFilteredData` before mutation, `writeAuditLog` called with before/after; `roStatusNotes` and `customerCommunicationNotes` keep existing append + timestamp behavior
- ✅ **Document upload MIME fix (v1.272)** — `uploadToSupabaseStorage` accepts `skipContentType` option; `uploadDocument` passes `skipContentType:true` to bypass bucket MIME policy for non-image files; improved error message with fix instructions; Roland confirmed bucket MIME list updated in Supabase dashboard
- ✅ **Document modal refresh fix (v1.273)** — After document upload, `currentFilteredData[index].photoLibrary` explicitly synced from `currentData[originalIndex].photoLibrary`; `openPhotoLibrary` accepts `initialTab = 'photos'|'docs'` param; modal closes and reopens on Documents tab after upload so new doc is immediately visible
- ✅ **60-second visibility note (v1.274)** — Document upload success alert now tells user documents may take up to 60 seconds to appear due to Supabase Storage propagation delay
- ✅ **Photo lightbox viewer (v1.275)** — Photo thumbnails tap to open full-screen lightbox; `openPhotoLightbox(photoIdx, libIndex)` renders full-size photo with prev/next nav, photo counter, "💾 Open / Save" link (opens in new tab/prompts save), "⭐ Set as Main" button (non-main) or "Main Photo" label (main); `navigateLightbox(dir)` cycles photos; `closePhotoLightbox()` removes overlay; `window._libPhotos`, `_libMainUrl`, `_libRoIndex` set at modal open for lightbox navigation; "Set as Main" moved from grid thumbnails to lightbox view
- ✅ **Email photos to customer (v1.275)** — "📧 Email Photos to Customer" button appears below photo grid if `ro.customerEmail` exists and photos are present; `openPhotoEmailModal(index)` shows overlay with checkboxes per photo (all pre-checked), pre-filled recipient email, optional message textarea; `sendPhotosToCustomer(index)` calls Edge Function with `type:'photo_share'`; `send-quote-email` Edge Function v1.4 adds `photo_share` branch — branded customer email with inline photo grid, each photo as clickable full-size link; **Roland must redeploy Edge Function** for this to work
- ✅ **Pre-deploy backup system** — `scripts/backup.sh` creates timestamped snapshots of all 6 key files in `.backups/`, keeps last 6 versions, runs before every push per End of Session Checklist
- ✅ **Photo & document upload fix (v1.271)** — `uploadDocument` fully migrated from Google Drive (was using expired `accessToken` → 401) to Supabase Storage (`uploadToSupabaseStorage` → `addDocToLibrary`); `uploadPhoto` and `uploadDocument` guards changed from `!getSB()` to `!getSB() || !supabaseSession`; session re-check added inside async `onchange` callback; error message updated to "Session expired — please refresh"
- ✅ **Email photos auth fix (v1.276)** — `sendPhotosToCustomer` switched from `session?.access_token` to `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` as Bearer token (consistent with `submitPartsRequest`); improved error handler checks `result.message` and HTTP status
- ✅ **CC on photo emails (Edge Function v1.4b)** — `send-quote-email` always CCs `repair@patriotsrvservices.com` on every photo_share email send
- ✅ **Spanish language toggle (v1.277, GH#12 — index.html)** — Globe toggle button (🌐 ES / 🌐 EN) in header; `TRANSLATIONS_ES` dictionary (~70 key/value pairs); `t(str)` helper (English key → Spanish or fallback); `getLang()`/`setLang()` reading/writing `prvs_lang` in localStorage; `translateStaticUI()` updates all `[data-i18n]` DOM elements and `[data-i18n-ph]` placeholders; `setupI18n()` tags static header/filter DOM elements at init() time; all RO card strings wrapped with `t()`: urgency options, status dropdown, info labels (Type/RV/VIN/Tech/Phone/Email/Address), section titles, placeholder texts, button labels, parts badges, insurance badges, QR section, time logs; `updateStats()` "RVs on Lot" translated; `setupI18n()` called via `setTimeout` at end of `init()`
- ✅ **Spanish language toggle (v1.27, GH#12 — checkin.html)** — Same `prvs_lang` localStorage key (shared with index.html); globe button in logo area; `TRANSLATIONS_ES` dict covering all check-in/out UI: RO info labels, clocked-in/out badges, timer header, service type section, work notes/dictation, action buttons, clock-out summary, auto clock-out modal, offline banner; `translateStaticUI()` called at DOMContentLoaded; `setLang()` triggers `render()` if already loaded
- ✅ **Duplicate ro_id 409 fix (v1.278)** — `generateROId()` is a deterministic 32-bit hash; same customer+RV+date (or any hash collision) produced identical IDs causing a Supabase 409 Conflict on insert. Added `async generateUniqueROId(name, rv, date)` which calls `generateROId()` then checks Supabase with `.maybeSingle()` before committing — if collision detected, appends `-2` through `-9`, then falls back to a base-36 timestamp suffix. Updated `appendToSupabase` to `await generateUniqueROId()`. Added try/catch at the New RO form submit handler so errors produce a user-visible alert instead of a silent uncaught promise rejection.
- ✅ **Video upload support (v1.279)** — Added `isVideoUrl(url)` helper (checks .mp4/.mov/.avi/.mkv/.webm/.m4v/.3gp extensions). `uploadPhoto` now accepts `image/*,video/*` and the image-only `continue` filter was widened to allow `video/` MIME types. Thumbnail grid renders a dark `🎬 VIDEO` tile for video URLs instead of a broken `<img>`. Lightbox renders `<video controls autoplay>` for videos and suppresses "Set as Main" (videos can't be an RO's main photo). Email modal shows videos as disabled/non-checkable with a `🎬 Video (not emailable)` label. "Add New Photo" button renamed "Add Photo / Video".
- ✅ **Fix RO insert race condition (v1.280)** — Replaced check-then-insert pattern (`generateUniqueROId` with pre-SELECT) with optimistic insert loop (`generateROIdCandidates` returns base + -2..-9 + timestamp fallback). `appendToSupabase` now tries each candidate in sequence; on `error.code === '23505'` it advances to the next; any other error is re-thrown. Eliminates the TOCTOU race where concurrent submits could both pass the pre-check and both fail on insert. Also added submit button disable/re-enable around the save call to prevent double-submissions.
- ✅ **Fix roId scope bug (v1.281)** — `appendToSupabase` optimistic insert loop used `for (const roId of candidates)`; the `console.log` after the loop referenced `roId` which is block-scoped to the loop body, causing `ReferenceError: roId is not defined`. Fixed by changing `console.log('✅ New RO saved:', roId)` to `console.log('✅ New RO saved:', data.ro_id)`.
- ✅ **Duplicate RO Manager (v1.282)** — `getBaseROId(roId)` strips `-2`/`-3`/`-XXXX` suffixes via regex to find the base PRVS hash. `findDuplicateGroups()` groups `currentData` by base ID and returns groups with 2+ members. Admin-only `🔗 Merge Dupes` button in header (hidden until dupes detected) with red badge count. `openDuplicateManager()` modal shows each group with radio buttons to pick the master RO. `executeDupeMerge()` reassigns foreign keys on `notes`, `parts`, `time_logs`, `insurance_scans`, `audit_log` tables; merges `photo_library` arrays; copies `rvPhotoUrl` from duplicate to master if master has none; DELETEs duplicate `repair_orders` rows; reloads data.
- ✅ **Fix isAdmin() timing bug for Merge Dupes button (v1.282b)** — `getUserInfo()` called with no Google token sets `currentUser = { email: 'unknown@user.com' }`. The `if (!currentUser)` guard in session restore then skips overwriting it with the real email. `isAdmin()` checks `currentUser.email` which is wrong. Fix: post-load dupe check now also checks `supabaseSession?.user?.email` directly against `ADMIN_EMAILS` (`const _sessionEmail = (supabaseSession?.user?.email || '').toLowerCase(); const _isAdminNow = isAdmin() || ADMIN_EMAILS.includes(_sessionEmail)`). Added `console.log('🔗 Dupe check: X duplicate(s) found, button shown/hidden')` for debugging.
- ✅ **Fix "Date RV Arrived on Lot" not saving (v1.283)** — `updateROInSupabase()` had `date_arrived` missing from its Supabase `.update()` payload. Value was correctly read from the Edit RO form into `formData.dateArrived` but silently dropped before the DB write. Fix: added `date_arrived: formData.dateArrived || null` to the payload. Explains why it appeared to work on some ROs (those whose date was auto-set via the status-change path) but failed on others (manually entered via Edit RO).
- ✅ **Parts chip states — three-state system (v1.284, GH#14)** — `parts_status` column added to `repair_orders` (CHECK constraint: 'sourcing', 'outstanding', 'received'). Three chips: 🔍 Part Sourcing (neon orange, pulsing), ⚠️ Parts Outstanding (yellow, pulsing), ✅ Parts Received (green). `openPartsStatusModal()` for Manager/Admin — click any chip to change state. `setPartsStatus()` writes to Supabase, logs note + audit entry. Auto-flip: `markPartReceived()` checks if all parts received/installed and calls `setPartsStatus(..., 'received')` automatically. Filter buttons: `ps-sourcing`, `ps-outstanding`, `ps-received`. `submitPartsRequest` sets `parts_status='outstanding'`. Backward compat with legacy `has_open_parts_request` boolean.
- ✅ **Parts Estimate chip + For Estimate Only toggle (v1.285, GH#14 cont.)** — Fourth state: 📋 Parts Estimate (blue, pulsing). Added to `parts_status` CHECK constraint. `For Estimate Only` toggle in Request Parts modal — sets `parts_status='estimate'` instead of `'outstanding'` when enabled. `syncEstimateToggle()` global function updates toggle visual (avoids inline `</script>` parser bug). Estimate button in `openPartsStatusModal`. `ps-estimate` filter button. Spanish: `ESTIMACIÓN DE PARTES`. bobby@, solar@, brandon@ added to `MANAGER_EMAILS` and Supabase `user_roles`.
- ✅ **ROLLBACK.md** — Emergency rollback guide committed to repo root. Step-by-step terminal instructions, version table with commands, hard-refresh note, GitHub Releases link, and direct Claude fallback option.
- ✅ **Rename Core Charge → Freight Charge (v1.286)** — UI label only in Add/Edit Part form Pricing section. DB column `core_charge` and JS variable `coreCharge` unchanged — no migration needed.
- ✅ **Wholesale + Retail Price columns in Manage Parts table (v1.287)** — Two new columns added between Qty and Quick: Wholesale (dark, right-aligned) and Retail (green, right-aligned). Formatted as `$X.XX` or `—` if not set. Empty-state colspan updated 7→9. git tag v1.287 created.
- ✅ **Sourcing added to individual part row status dropdown (v1.288)** — Added `'Sourcing'` to `PART_STATUSES` array (between In Transit and Received) and `PART_STATUS_COLORS` (neon orange #ff6a00, matching RO-level chip). Clarified that RO-level chips (Sourcing/Outstanding/Received/Estimate) are separate from per-part-row statuses.
- ✅ **Supplier Contact section moved to top of Add/Edit Part form (v1.289)** — New section order: 🏢 Supplier Contact → 🔩 Core Info → 📦 Order Info → 💰 Pricing → ✅ Receipt. Applies to both Add New Part and Edit Part (shared form).
